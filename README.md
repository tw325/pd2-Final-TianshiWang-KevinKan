GALCON
======
Tianshi Wang (Tyler) and Kevin Kan

Galcon is a high-paced galactic arcade-strategy game. Send ships to different planets, and conquer the galaxy! However, you won't be the only race in hopes of world domination.

The player starts with one "home" planet and sends off a portion of the ships to another planet to conquer it. The goal of the game is to compete against the computer(s) to conquer more planets. The number of ships each planet contains "grows" as time passes proportionally to the size of the planet. 

You are playing as blue. Expand by taking the neutral gray planets, or conquer the red and win.

Run the file in Java Processing and click your planet and then another to send your ships. Double click to select all of your planets. Every time you target another planet, you send 50% of the ships on your selected planet.

The game is currently working with a successful AI using implementation of ArrayLists! This version is in Galcon.

However, we are having some bugs with our implementation of LinkedLists. This version is in Galcon1.

Have fun playing!
