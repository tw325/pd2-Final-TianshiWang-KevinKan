GALCON

Tianshi Wang (Tyler) and Kevin Kan

Galcon is a high-paced galactic arcade-strategy game. Send ships to different planets, and conquer the galaxy! However, you won't be the only race in hopes of world domination.

The player starts with one "home" planet and sends off a portion of the ships to another planet to conquer it. The goal of the game is to compete against the computer(s) to conquer more planets. The number of ships each planet will "build" is proportional to the size of the planet. 

Run the file in Java Processing and click a planet to send your ships.
