**06.03.14**<br>
*Kevin Kan* <br>
- began the basic setup (void, draw, background, etc)

*Tyler Wang* 
- inspiration search

**06.04.14**<br>
*Kevin Kan* <br>
- chose image for spaceship, red planet and blue planet

*Tyler Wang* <br>
- chose image for background
- scaled images

**06.06.14**<br>
*Tyler Wang* <br>
- decided new images for background, gray planet, red planet, and blue planet
- scaled new images

*Kevin Kan* <br>
- placed planets on image.
- created spaceship class.

**06.07.14**<br>
*Tyler Wang* <br>
- Established Background
- Replaced Cursor
- Made ring class to highlight planets
- Made planet image sizes equal(96x96)

**06.08.14**<br>
*Kevin Kan* <br>
- Created planets of different sizes (Small are 72x72, medium are 96x96, large are  120x120)
- Ring constructor adjusted to specifics of images
- Added different rates for spaceship production
(small rate is every 1 second, medium rate is every .8 seconds, and large rate is every .5 seconds)
(gray planets have a 50% chance of producing a ship)
- Enabled highlighting of all planets and up to 2 highlights only. 

**06.09.14**<br>
*Kevin/Tyler* - Pair Programming <br>
- resized planets
- resized spaceships
- more variables and code into planet.pde

*Kevin Kan* <br>
- Attempted to adjust code to better efficiency
- Attempted again after Tyler's work
- Added in ring creation (simple version)
- Created spaceship class.

*Tyler Wang* <br>
- Created planet class which constructs each planet with center, color, radius, and spaceships
- Attempted to incorporate planets in an array

**06.10.14**<br>
*Kevin/Tyler* - Pair Programming <br>
- added planet class
- started ring creation again - encountered problems 

**06.11.14** <br>
*Kevin/Tyler* - Pair Programming <br>
- Worked on ring creation -> partially fixed.
- Ring can toggle, but can not recognize only 2 rings

*Kevin* <br>
- Fixed Ring functionality. (inRadiusAny(), allOff())
- Added line drawing! when linking 2 planets (linesave(), line())
- Note: very important to organize what needs to show up on top and bottom with the draw() function.

**06.13.14**<br>
*Tyler Wang* <br>
- Changed growth rates of planets based on size
- Created spaceship class
- Adjusted angle and speed of spaceships using trig formulas
- Finished spaceship movement using rotate and translate methods

*Kevin Kan* <br>
- Got rid of mouseOver() -> put into draw()
- Put in new planets 
- Created an allOn() method for rings
- Made rings when hovering over planets 
- Made lines to join HoverRings
- Attempted decreasing number of ships

**06.14.14** <br>
*Tyler Wang* <br>
- Implemented spaceship subtraction system

**06.15.14** <br>
*Kevin Kan* <br>
- Attempted spaceship movement/creation (failed)
- Created a basic menu
- Created Menu (May add instructions on menu screen).
- Created Pause/Play feature
- Replaced linesave with home/target(choice1,choice2) variables.

*Tyler Wang* <br>
- Built on Galcon menu screen
- Fixed menu "start" button bug.
- started spaceships again
