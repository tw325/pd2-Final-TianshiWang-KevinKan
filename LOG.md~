*Kevin Kan* <br>
- began the basic setup (void, draw, background, etc)

*Tyler Wang* 
- inspiration search

**06.04.14**<br>
*Kevin Kan* <br>
- chose image for spaceship, red planet and blue planet

*Tyler Wang* <br>
- chose image for background
- scaled images

**06.06.14**<br>
*Tyler Wang* <br>
- decided new images for background, gray planet, red planet, and blue planet
- scaled new images

*Kevin Kan* <br>
- placed planets on image.
- created spaceship class.

**06.07.14**<br>
*Tyler Wang* <br>
- Established Background
- Replaced Cursor
- Made ring class to highlight planets
- Made planet image sizes equal(96x96)

**06.08.14**<br>
*Kevin Kan* <br>
- Created planets of different sizes (Small are 72x72, medium are 96x96, large are  120x120)
- Ring constructor adjusted to specifics of images
- Added different rates for spaceship production
(small rate is every 1 second, medium rate is every .8 seconds, and large rate is every .5 seconds)
(gray planets have a 50% chance of producing a ship)
- Enabled highlighting of all planets and up to 2 highlights only. 

**06.09.14**<br>
*Kevin/Tyler* - Pair Programming <br>
- resized planets
- resized spaceships
- more variables and code into planet.pde

*Kevin Kan* <br>
- Attempted to adjust code to better efficiency
- Attempted again after Tyler's work
- Added in ring creation (simple version)
- Created spaceship class.

*Tyler Wang* <br>
- Created planet class which constructs each planet with center, color, radius, and spaceships
- Attempted to incorporate planets in an array
